<h1>Welcome To My Portfolio</h1>
<p> I am learning Full Stack Web Development with a goal in Software Engineering and my long term goal of Digital Forensics and Cybersecurity.<br>
    I am proficient in problem solving, being detail oriented, and am highly organized.
    I am able to naturally see patterns, efficiencies and inefficiencies.
    <br>
    My favorite sport is cycling because it is about mental strength and pushing one's self to meet goals, 
    to see what is up ahead and prepare how I will accomplish it.<br>
    I use this to think about projects, plans or problems.
    I also enjoy mountain biking, trail running and hiking for the joy of being out in nature alone or with friends,<br> 
    this is the down time and the mental break I give myself from cycling and learning.
    <br>
    I hope that you enjoy looking over this portfolio. (Still a work in progress.)<br>
    Thank you for visiting.
    <br>
    Ginny Carr</p>
